Comparing the Implementation with the Operational Concept developed in Project #1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

REQUIREMENT 10: Shall contain a brief text document that compares this implementation with the concept developed in Project #1.

Comparison between the implemented Test Harness and the concept previously developed:
1) The concept parses the XML requests in the initial stages, even before the ChildAppDomain is created. However, the Test Harness implementation parses the request
   after the ChildAppDomain is created for each XML request.
2) According to the concept, the DLLs are extracted from the request even before ChildAppDomain is created. In the implementation, the DLLs are extracted fr each request
   after creating a ChildAppDomain for each request. The implementation proves to be effective as only the necessary DLLs for a particular request can be extracted.
3) The concept addresses the amount of information that is given back to the user as a result log. The implementation however, provides only the necessary information
   including the test results.

Does this project fully implement its concept?
The implementation has followed the concept in most of the cases, including the design, package structure and organizing principle with minor modifications.
There are certain issues from the concept pertaining to security and user interfaces, which could not be implemeted in this version of Test Harness. However, 
those concerns will be addressed in the next version of this Test Harness.

Points that made the original concept less relevant:
Points 1 and 2, mentioned above in the comparison made the original concept less relevant. It makes sense to parse the request and extract the DLLs after the ChildAppDomain
is created for each request as this would give the flexibility to concentrate only on the necessary XML requests and DLLs rather than an entire list of parsed XMLs 
and unrelated DLLs.
